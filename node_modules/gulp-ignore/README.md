gulp-ignore ![status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/robrich/gulp-ignore.png?branch=master)
===========

Include or exclude [gulp](https://github.com/wearefractal/gulp) files from the stream based on a condition

Note
----

`gulp.src()` now supports multiple globs including ignore globs.  See [glob-stream](https://github.com/wearefractal/glob-stream).  In most cases, this is sufficient, removing the need for this plugin.

```javascript
gulp.task('kill-js', function() {
  gulp.src(['./**/*.js','!./node_modules/**','!./libs/**'])
    .pipe(something());
});
```

Usage
-----

Uglify everything but only copy certain things to the dist folder

```javascript
var exclude = require('gulp-ignore').exclude;
var uglify = require('gulp-uglify');

gulp.task('task', function() {
  gulp.src('./src/*.js')
    .pipe(uglify())
    .pipe(exclude('./libs/**'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/'));
});
```

```javascript
var include = require('gulp-ignore').include;
var uglify = require('gulp-uglify');

gulp.task('task', function() {
  gulp.src('./src/*.js')
    .pipe(uglify())
    .pipe(include('**/*.min.*'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/'));
});
```

API
---

### exclude(condition)

Exclude files whose `file.path` matches, include everything else

### include(condition)

Include files whose `file.path` matches, exclude everything else

### condition

Type: `boolean` or [`stat`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats) object or `function` that takes in a vinyl file and returns a boolean or `RegularExpression` that works on the `file.path`

The condition parameter is any of the conditions supported by [gulp-match](https://github.com/robrich/gulp-match).  The `file.path` is passed into `gulp-match`.

If a function is given, then the function is passed a vinyl `file`. The function should return a `boolean`.
